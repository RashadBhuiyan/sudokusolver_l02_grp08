\section{Introduction}
Sudoku is a popular logic-based game most often played on physical media such as books and newspapers. Aside from its entertainment value, Sudoku is also a problem frequently of interest in computer science, featured in over 33,000 academic articles on Google Scholar. An inconvenience that players face is a lack of timely access to published solutions, resulting in the absence of immediate feedback. Additionally, the process of manually checking for solution correctness on a 9x9 table is tedious and prone to error. As avid Sudoku lovers and software engineers, we seek to implement an accessible platform for people to upload images of incomplete Sudoku boards and then solve those puzzles and showcase their solutions.
