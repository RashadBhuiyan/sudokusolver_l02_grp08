\section{Team Meeting Plan}
All team members are expected to meet twice a week during the specified 3XA3 lab sessions on Monday and Thursday for 2 hours, totalling 4 hours a week. These meetings will be held either in-person at the Information Technology Building in room 236 or virtually through Discord, given the circumstances that week. Any additional work required will be done individually outside of meeting times. During these meetings, discussions regarding project design, implementation, as well as any necessary documentation will occur. Rashad will be responsible for chairing the meetings while Kai and Stanley will be responsible for updating the agenda and taking meeting minutes. Should a member be unable to attend a meeting, they must notify all other members as soon as possible. 

\section{Team Communication Plan}
Communication will be done through a combination of Discord and Microsoft Teams. Each member is expected to respond in a timely manner. Microsoft Teams will be used for formal communication with TAs and the professor while in-team communication will be done through Discord. Git issues will also be used to keep track of current workflow within the project and staying updated on what needs to be done.

\section{Technology}

Sudoku Solver will be written and developed using Python, with the front-end portion of the application being developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and Python Flask as the web framework. The project will also use OpenCV to allow for interpretation of Sudoku boards from uploaded pictures. To test the program, we will be using the Pytest framework. Pydoc will be used for documentation of code and document generation.

\section{Coding Style}

Sudoku Solver will be using the PEP-8 coding style. Information for the coding style can be found at https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/.
