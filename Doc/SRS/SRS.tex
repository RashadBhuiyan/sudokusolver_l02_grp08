This document describes the requirements for a Sudoku Solver.  The template for the Software
Requirements Specification (SRS) is a subset of the Volere
template~\citep{RobertsonAndRobertson2012}.  If you make further modifications
to the template, you should explicity state what modifications were made.

\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
The purpose of this software application is to provide a comprehensive suite of tools for generating, recognizing, and solving Sudoku puzzles. The application will provide a web-based front-end with an intuitive interface to cater to users of different technical abilities on most modern hardware. Computer vision is also utilized to improve ease of use, by directly interfacing puzzles from print-media to the application.

\subsection{The Stakeholders}
\subsubsection{The Client}
The client of the project are the instructor, Dr. Asghar Bokhari, and teaching assistants of SFWRENG 3XA3. The clients stipulate the content and deadlines of the deliverables.

\subsubsection{The Customers}
The customers are any individuals with an interest in Sudoku. These includes hobbyists who seek to play the game or verify their solutions. The application is suitable for all demographics who can operate a web browser.

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
Other stakeholders of the project include math teachers who may print generated puzzles from the application to use in educational setting. Tim Ruscica, the original developer of the open source Sudoku GUI Solver upon which this project is based on, also has a stake in seeing the expansion of features that stem from his work. Additionally, members of the SudoCrew development team are also stakeholders responsible for implementing and testing the application.

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

\subsubsection{Facts}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The original repository for the existing Sudoku solver has approximately 500 lines of code spread across 3 Python files.
    \item The existing implementation solves only contains a single static Sudoku board and displays the solution as a plain-text output.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Assumptions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The user has a stable Internet connection to use the web application.
    \item The user knows the basic basic rules of Sudoku.
    \item If the image upload option is to be used, the user has a legible photo of the whole puzzle board.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{The Scope of the Work and the Product}

\subsubsection{The Context of the Work}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sudoku_scope}
    \caption{Work Context Diagram}
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}

The user either uploads a manually inputted or photographed Sudoku to receive feedback on a valid solution, or plays the game on a randomly generated puzzle grid. The Web front-end handles user input and interactive game-play while passing and receiving solution data to the back-end solver application.

\subsubsection{Individual Product Use Cases}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{use_case}
    \caption{Use Case Diagram}
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}
The use case diagram above shows the various ways a user can interact with our web application. Since Starting a Sudoku game involves multiple game-play actions itself, it has a lot of included use cases. Furthermore, there are multiple levels of extends cases when verifying and sudoku board solutions as each complex use case is broken into simpler cases.

\subsection{Usability and Humanity Requirements}

\subsection{Performance Requirements}

\subsection{Operational and Environmental Requirements}

\subsection{Maintainability and Support Requirements}

\subsection{Security Requirements}

\subsection{Cultural Requirements}

\subsection{Legal Requirements}

\subsection{Health and Safety Requirements}

This section is not in the original Volere template, but health and safety are
issues that should be considered for every engineering project.

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}
Sudoku recognition with computer vision may constitute a major challenge due to the large variety of factors that can affect image recognition, such as photo resolution, sharpness, exposure, angle, and colour balance. 

The image upload feature may also expose the system to potential attacks in the form of malicious file content.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
OpenCV provides a suite of image processing functions such as adaptive thresholding and colour conversion that can be used to preprocess uploaded photos and improve their recognizability. 

\subsection{New Problems}
Higher traffic to the web application and the increased calls to the image recognizer and solver may increase the load on the system and potentially delay response times or cause crashes.

\subsection{Tasks}
Task schedules and delegated responsibilities are outlined in the project \href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/bhuiyr2/sudokusolver_l02_grp08/-/blob/main/ProjectSchedule/Gantt_Sudoku.pdf}{Gantt Chart}.

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
The project will initially be hosted on GitLab and migrate to a hosting service such as Heroku for deployment of the proof-of-concept and final product.

\subsection{Risks}
The application does not collect user information and so does not expose users to data security risks. As a web application, the main risk to the system are higher-than-expected traffic overwhelming the system through high processing load, or malicious attacks including denial-of-service and viral uploads.

\subsection{Costs}
The project does not involve monetary cost as it uses only open-source resources. A labour cost of between 5-10 hours per week is expected from each group member during the development period outlined in the \href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/bhuiyr2/sudokusolver_l02_grp08/-/blob/main/ProjectSchedule/Gantt_Sudoku.pdf}{Gantt Chart}.

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
\subsubsection{Documentation}
Basic instructions and rules of Sudoku will be outlined in the game interface. The user interface will also inform the user of any errors and provide remedy instructions, such as in the case of an unrecognizable photo, invalid input, or unsolvable uploaded puzzle.

\subsubsection{Training}
No training is required to use this application beyond the basic knowledge of using a web browser.

\subsection{Waiting Room}
Additional quality-of-life features, given extra development time, may include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Account system that saves player statistics such as solved puzzles and past uploads.
    \item Multiplayer challenge system that pits two players against each other on the same puzzle to improve the fun, competitive aspect of the game.
\end{enumerate}
