\section{General Information}

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to describe the testing, validation, and verification procedures that will be implemented for our Sudoku Solver program. The majority of the unit testing will be accomplished through PyTest as our program is primarily written using Python. Structural testing will be done using individually-created testing classes for proper analysis of branching. Non-functional requirements will primarily be realized through manual testing as there is a heavy emphasis on visualization of our project. System testing is done before proof-of-concept demonstration, revision 0 demonstration, and the final demonstration.

\subsection{Scope}
This test plan provides a basis for testing the functionality of the extended implementation and every new addition to the original Sudoku Solver algorithm by TechWithTim. Since the extended implementation involves creating a web application and methods of playing the game, the scope of testing covers web-application navigation and management, Sudoku generation and solution algorithms, and image recognition algorithms through machine learning. This document provides testing methodologies that covers the scope of the program as well as outlining all methods and tools used for testing.

\subsection{Overview of Document}
This document contains all information regarding the testing plan for the Sudoku Solver project. An overall plan will be addressed through a schedule as well as creation of a testing team. Furthermore, every functional and non-functional requirement from the SRS will be addressed and tested using various form of blackbox and whitebox testing. PoC testing will cover a specific sample of methods and will highlight some key differences of implementation between the original project and the current implementation.

\subsection{Software Description}
The purpose of this software application is to provide a comprehensive suite of tools for generating, recognizing, and solving Sudoku puzzles. The application will provide a web-based front-end with an intuitive interface to cater to users of different technical abilities on most modern hardware. Computer vision is also utilized to improve ease of use, by directly interfacing puzzles from print-media to the application.

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\section{Tests for Proof of Concept}

The primary feature in the PoC is the application's ability to recognize a Sudoku image and display the recognized digits on a web-based front-end. Therefore, tests for the PoC will focus on image extraction, digit recognition, and front-end presentation.

\subsection{Board image extraction}
		
This portion of the testing focuses on the extraction of Sudoku board and cell image data from a set of 10 photographs of varying perspective, brightness, and clarity. The output is compared manually with the expected output in each case, since automatic testing of computer vision results is an advanced topic beyond the scope of this project.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{poc-ie1\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual
					
Initial State: SudokuCV object is instantiated
					
Input: 10 different photographs of Sudoku boards, and 3 photographs without Sudoku
					
Output: flattened and cropped images of Sudoku boards, or raise error if no board is detected.
					
How test will be performed: SudokuCV object is supplied with input image through the recognize() method with the show\_image parameter set to true. This displays the input and output images for manual validation.
					
\item{poc-ie2\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual
					
Initial State: SudokuCV object is instantiated
					
Input: 10 different photographs of Sudoku boards
					
Output: An array of 81 images each cropped from a cell on the 9x9 Sudoku board
					
How test will be performed: array of numpy output is displayed using the Opencv imshow() method and manually validated against the input image.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Digit recognition}
\begin{enumerate}

\item{poc-dr1\\}

Type: Non-functional, Dynamic, Automatic
					
Initial State: a neural network model is trained from the handwritten and printed digits data set
					
Input: 10000 MNIST handwritten numbers test set
					
Output: percentage accuracy of the model prediction
					
How test will be performed: cvtraining module compares the labels of the input data set against the prediction made by the trained model and returns the rate of correct predictions.

\item{poc-dr2\\}

Type: Non-functional, Dynamic, Manual
					
Initial State: SudokuCV object is instantiated with trained model
					
Input: 10 photographs of Sudoku boards with handwritten and printed numbers
					
Output: an integer array of size 81 with recognized digits
					
How test will be performed: SudokuCV object supplies the array of recognized digits (0 for empty cells) and a corresponding array of confidence rates for each index. Digits with a confidence greater than 75\% are displayed and manually compared against the input images to calculate recognition accuracy.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Front-end presentation}
\begin{enumerate}

\item{poc-fp1\\}

Type: functional, Dynamic, manual
					
Initial State: Flask app is running using an initialized SudokuCV object
					
Input: 10 photographs of Sudoku boards with handwritten and printed numbers
					
Output: HTML page displaying extracted board image and table of recognized digits 
					
How test will be performed: The photographs are uploaded one at a time through the web-based GUI, the output table is manually compared to the original photograph to validate that digits are displayed correctly in the Sudoku grid format.

\item{poc-fp2\\}

Type: functional, Dynamic, manual
					
Initial State: Flask app is running using an initialized SudokuCV object
					
Input: 3 invalid Sudoku photographs (too small, no Sudoku puzzle, and empty grid)
					
Output: HTML page displaying error and suggested solution
					
How test will be performed: The photographs are uploaded one at a time through the web-based GUI, the output is manually compared against the expected error for each input image.

\end{enumerate}

	
\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	
				
\section{Unit Testing Plan}
		
\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}
The internal functions of the system mostly include the Sudoku solver algorithm itself, the Sudoku board generator, and the image recognition functions. To test such functions, it is simple enough to give these functions an input and ensure that the output is what is to be expected from that given input. Since most of the internal functions is written in Python and JavaScript, we will be utilizing the pytest and Mocha testing frameworks for both programming languages respectively. Since the board generator generates random boards, it is not possible to generate and test every single randomly generated board. Therefore, unit testing for Sudoku board generation will be done by testing individual functions that check for board validity, solvability, and uniqueness. These individual functions serve as the basis for random Sudoku board generation, and thus reinforces the validity of the generation. 
		
\subsection{Unit testing of output files}		
Unit testing the output files of the system will be done by inputting various Sudoku boards via picture (or manual input) into the web application, and ensuring that the outputted solution follows the Sudoku rules and is complete. The outputted Sudoku boards can be scraped from the web application, transformed into an array format, and be used as an input into a function that tests whether a complete Sudoku board follows the Sudoku rules.
